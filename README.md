# Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare

## Plotly

1. Use the D3 library to read a JSON

2. Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

3. Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.

4. Display the sample metadata which covers an individual's demographic information.

5. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

6. Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
7. Created a gauge chart to demonstrate weekly washing frequency

## Deployment

Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. Submit the links to your deployment and your GitHub repo.
